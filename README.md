# FriendFinder

Friend Finder is a program using HTML/Javascript/Node/Express.

You answer the 10 questions survey and are matched with someone who's score is the closest to yours, with that person's name and picture being shown to you in a modal.

I did not get the program working before needing to be submitted. I will come back to it, and get it operational.
